!!! question "What is a homelab ?"
    A homelab is the name given to a or multiple servers that resides locally in your home and where you host several applications and virtualized systems for testing, developing and for home, personal and functional usage.
    For example, this project aim to host a bunch of things including a password manager and a recipe book.  
    Most homelab are old gaming computers or Raspberry Pis but some could compete with small to medium company infrastructure.  
    For further investigation, I recommend having a look to [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/).

# Context

As a computer enthusiast and a human living in a SaaS market full of really expensive platforms I want to find a solution that will allow me to make some savings and ensure my privacy on the internet is as intact as possible.  
As a DevOps engineer I want to practice, learn and develop new skills.  
Add this to a freshly graduate innocent engineer this lead to my first homelab that has its pros and cons. In this documentation and [blog](blog/index.md) I will write about the research, experimentation and choices in the path of this new project.
