Setting up a monitoring stack for a homelab is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and security. It allows you to track resource usage, perform health checks, and quickly troubleshoot issues, minimizing downtime. Overall, a robust monitoring setup is essential for maintaining a well-functioning and efficient homelab.

# Requirements definition

Monitoring the infrastructure is crucial to detect potential hardware problems or limitations, have security insight (brut-force attack for example) and to track applications resource consumption. For both the system and containers I want to monitor CPU, RAM, Disks (including RAID) usage and capacity. I want as well to retrieve system and applicative logs. I could also be handy to be allowed to implement other visualizations like fail2ban stats.

On this article I will explore the following stacks.

## Prometheus + Grafana
: Prometheus stores collects real-time metrics, while Grafana visualizes them in dashboards. It has to be completed with exporters for specific data (cadvisor for containers, Node-exporter for system, fail2ban-exporter for security)

Pros
: - Highly flexible and extensible with numerous exporters available.
: - Grafana provides rich and interactive visualizations.

Cons
: - Prometheus can be complex to configure for beginners.
: - Long-term data management may require additional solutions.

## Zabbix
: An open-source monitoring solution for IT infrastructures, with a web interface.

Pros
: Rich and functional user interface.
: Capable of monitoring a wide range of services and applications.

Cons
: Can be resource-intensive.
: Steep learning curve for advanced configuration.

## Dozzle
: A log viewer for Docker, allowing real-time monitoring of container logs.

Pros
: Lightweight and easy to install.
: Ideal for Docker environments.

Cons
: Limited functionality compared to more comprehensive solutions.
: Lacks advanced monitoring or alerting capabilities.

## Uptime-Kuma
: An open-source monitoring tool for website and service availability.

Pros
: Easy to configure and use.
: Ideal for monitoring service availability.

Cons
: Limited functionality compared to more comprehensive solutions.
: Less suitable for detailed performance monitoring.
