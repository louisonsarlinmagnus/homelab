In a homelab environment, selecting the most suitable container orchestration tool is crucial for optimizing experimentation and management.  
This article compares Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes light distribution (like K0S and Minikube), and Kubernetes to identify the best fit for my use case. Docker Compose simplifies multi-container setups while Docker Swarm provides straightforward clustering and scaling, and K0S and Minikube offer lightweight Kubernetes experiences for testing and learning.

# Definitions

Docker Compose
: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file to configure services, networks, and volumes.

Docker Swarm
: Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool that allows you to manage a group of Docker engines as a single virtual system for deploying applications.

Lightweight Kubernetes distributions (K0s, K3s, minikube, etc.)
: Simplified versions of Kubernetes designed for local development or small-scale deployments, making it easy to run Kubernetes clusters on personal machines.

Kubernetes
: An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines.
